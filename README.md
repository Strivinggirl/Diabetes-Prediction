# Diabetes Prediction Using SVM

This project is a simple machine learning model that predicts whether a person has diabetes using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm.

## ðŸ”¹ What This Project Does
- Uses the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset** to analyze health data  
- Applies **data preprocessing** (like scaling) for better accuracy  
- Trains an **SVM classifier** to predict diabetes based on health factors  

## ðŸ“‚ About the Dataset
The dataset contains medical details like:  
- **Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Age, etc.**  
- The target column, **Outcome**, tells whether a person has diabetes (**1**) or not (**0**).
